"""Cash on Delivery (پرداخت در محل) adapter.

COD is modeled as a gateway adapter for uniform dispatch — checkout code
doesn't need gateway-specific conditionals. However, COD differs from
online gateways:

- No external API calls
- No redirect
- No server-to-server verification
- Order is NOT marked as paid immediately — it remains in payment_status=PENDING
  (or a COD-specific status) until delivery confirmation
- No credentials required

The adapter's create_payment returns a result with a synthetic track_id
(the payment attempt's own public_id) and no redirect URL. The checkout
service uses the is_online=False signal to skip the redirect flow entirely.
