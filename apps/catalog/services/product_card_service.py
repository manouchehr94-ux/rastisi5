"""Universal Product Card business-data resolver — U3.

``catalog/partials/product_card.html`` is reused, unmodified, from every
product-bearing surface in the storefront (homepage sections, listings,
collections, search, related products) — see the grep-confirmed include
sites in ``storefront_builder/templates/storefront_builder/sections/*.html``
and ``catalog/partials/product_grid.html``/``product_list_results.html``.
Before this module, the price/discount/badge/quick-add business rules lived
*inside that template* as direct ``product.discount_percent``/
``product.final_price``/``product.tag`` lookups — meaning any future visual
card variant would have had to re-derive (and could silently diverge on)
the same business semantics.

This module is the single place that turns a ``Product`` instance into the
plain, already-decided facts a card (any visual variant of it) needs to
render. It never queries the database itself — it only reads fields/
properties/prefetch caches the caller already loaded, exactly the way
``render_service``'s existing context builders already
``select_related("brand")``/``prefetch_related("images", "metafields")``
before handing products to a template. Calling this once per already-fetched
product is therefore O(1) queries added, regardless of grid size.

Capability boundary (documented, not silently guessed): ``Product`` has no
store/product-level low-stock threshold field — only ``ProductVariant.
low_stock_threshold``/``WarehouseInventory.low_stock_threshold`` do (Phase 1D).
Deriving a single "low stock" fact for a product-grid card would mean either
picking one arbitrary variant's threshold (misleading for a variable
product with many variants) or issuing a per-card variant query (an N+1
regression). Per the "no fabricated stock claims" rule, ``is_low_stock`` is
therefore always ``False`` today; a future phase can wire this up once a
product-level (or query-batched, N+1-safe) threshold exists.

#: ``Product.Tag`` (marketing label) → badge key (== the existing
#: ``pill-{key}`` CSS class already shipped in ``product_card.css``).
#: ``sale`` intentionally maps to the same ``new`` visual treatment as
#: before this module existed (the pre-U3 template rendered
#: ``<span class="pill pill-new">حراج</span>`` for the ``sale`` tag too —
#: preserved verbatim here, not a new design decision). Labels reuse the
#: model's own ``get_tag_display()`` (single source of truth), never a
#: second hardcoded translation table. The discount-percent pill is
#: deliberately NOT one of these — its digits still need the template's
#: ``fa_number`` filter (Persian numerals), so it stays a dedicated
#: ``discount_percent``/``is_on_sale`` pair the template formats itself,
#: exactly as it did before this module existed.
