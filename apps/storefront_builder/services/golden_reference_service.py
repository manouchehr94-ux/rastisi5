"""Golden Reference Storefront (G1) — composition service.

The Golden Reference Storefront is the customized ``rasti-mode-demo`` store: a
visually complete premium multi-brand fashion/lifestyle storefront that a
prospective merchant can visit to understand what a finished RastiSi store
looks like.

Design authority:
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-golden-reference-storefront-design.md``
Executable plan:
``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-04-golden-reference-storefront-g1-plan.md``

Architecture model (this is the load-bearing correctness contract):

  A Ready Template's identity + version must always describe its **actual
  registered authored DNA**. So the Golden setup does NOT hand a modified
  preset object to ``apply_preset`` while keeping the official key/version —
  that would make ``template_baseline_snapshot`` (the pure authored template
  truth the future Phase-1 reset relies on) lie about what the template
  authored.

  Instead the Golden setup mirrors exactly what a real merchant does:

    1. Seed the resettable ``rasti-mode-demo`` (real catalog/content).
    2. Obtain the REAL registered ``fashion_promo_catalog`` recipe.
    3. Apply that real preset normally (``preset_service.apply_preset``) so the
       Draft carries honest ``template_provenance`` AND a truthful
       ``template_baseline_snapshot`` = the authored ``fashion_promo_catalog``
       baseline.
    4. Customize the resulting Draft the way a merchant would, through existing
       production contracts — palette selection, Store-Appearance manifest
       (header/footer/bottom-nav), header config, and Home section
       composition. These writes NEVER touch ``template_baseline_snapshot``, so
       the live Draft becomes ``authored baseline + Golden merchant
       divergences`` — precisely the model future Phase-1 semantics expect.
    5. Publish.

The live Golden Draft may (and does) differ substantially from the
``fashion_promo_catalog`` authored baseline. That is intended.

No new Ready Template is created; the A8 catalog stays at exactly 50. No second
preset identity, renderer, or Store-Appearance/Mega-Menu architecture is
introduced — only existing registered contracts are used.

Mega Menu note: the visible category mega menu is an intrinsic authored feature
of the ``marketplace_search_first`` **header** identity (its partial renders the
real Store category tree). Its truthful, future-Builder-editable source is the
Header selection (``header.marketplace_search_first.v1``). The ``mega_menu``
Store-Appearance family has a single registered component, ``mega_menu.none.v1``
(``virtual:mega_menu:none`` — "no separate mega-menu overlay"), which is the
correct, consistent selection here; the header owns its own category panel.

Guardrails: this service only ever operates on the store handed to it (the
management command scopes that to the fixed ``rasti-mode-demo`` slug). It never
writes commerce truth (price/stock/SKU) and bakes no catalog IDs into settings
— product sections resolve their products at render time from Catalog via
``data_source``.
