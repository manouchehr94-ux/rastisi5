The persisted manifest contains only stable component identities.  This module
turns those identities into trusted, platform-owned registry implementations
once per ``StorefrontLayoutVersion`` render.  It is deliberately not a second
renderer: Preview and Public continue to use ``services.render_service`` and
thread this typed state through the existing global-region/section helpers.
