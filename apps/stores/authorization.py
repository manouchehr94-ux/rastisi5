"""StoreMembership-based merchant-dashboard authorization.

This module is the single place that decides "may this User act on this
Store's merchant dashboard, and with which permissions." It replaces the
historical, tenant-blind ``user.is_staff`` check that
``apps.dashboard.decorators.staff_required`` used on its own (see
``docs/docs/product/00_PROJECT_MASTER_REFERENCE.md`` §10.2/§11.1 — this was
the explicitly recorded, highest-priority gap: any ``is_staff=True`` account
could reach *any* Store's ``/admin-portal/`` once Host-based Store resolution
picked that Store, because nothing checked *which* Store the user actually
belonged to).

Authorization here is layered on top of, not a replacement for, tenant
resolution (``apps.stores.resolution``): resolution decides *which* Store a
request is for; this module decides *whether* the requesting User may act on
that Store, and *what* they may do. Neither layer substitutes for the other.

Only an ``ACTIVE`` ``StoreMembership`` row for the exact Store in question
grants access — never ``is_staff``, ``is_superuser``, membership in a
*different* Store, or an ``INVITED``/``REVOKED`` row.

Role naming note (Phase 1B): the originating request names roles as
"Owner / Administrator / Manager / Product Manager / Order Manager /
Content Manager / Analyst or Read-Only." Per that same request's own
instruction to reuse existing role names rather than create a duplicate
role system, this maps onto the ``StoreMembership.Role`` choices that
already existed before this PR:

* Owner            -> ``Role.OWNER``
* Administrator     -> ``Role.ADMINISTRATOR`` (also covers the generic
  "Manager" description — full operational access short of ownership-tier
  actions like staff/domain/subscription management)
* Product Manager   -> ``Role.CATALOG_MANAGER``
* Order Manager     -> ``Role.ORDER_MANAGER``
* Content Manager   -> ``Role.CONTENT_EDITOR``
* Analyst/Read-Only -> ``Role.ANALYST``

No new ``Role`` value was added.
