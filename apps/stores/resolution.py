"""Authoritative request-time Store resolution.

This module is the ONLY place in the codebase that decides "which Store
does this HTTP request belong to." No view, context processor, dashboard
service, or future business-logic code should independently guess a Store
from a hostname, a caller-supplied ID, the authenticated user, a Vendor, a
Product, a Cart, or a session value. See
``docs/architecture/SAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md`` ("Request Store Context") for
the policy this module implements, and
``docs/architecture/SAAS_DOMAIN_DECISIONS.md`` for why tenant resolution,
authentication, authorization, and data filtering are kept as separate
concerns.

Resolution source of truth: ``StoreDomain.hostname`` — verified domains of
an active Store only (``domain_is_eligible_for_routing``). A narrow,
explicitly isolated, temporary compatibility fallback additionally allows a
fixed allowlist of local-development hosts to resolve to the Akhlaghi Store,
but only while the database contains exactly one, active, "akhlaghi" Store
(``resolve_compatibility_store``). The fallback fails closed the moment a
second Store exists — it is not a permanent behavior.
